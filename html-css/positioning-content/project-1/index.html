                            <p>In our urban and suburban houses what should we do wrNout cats, In our stting or
                                bedrooms, our libraries, in our
                                krtchens and storerooms, our farms, bams, and nckyards, in our docks, our granaries, our
                                ships, and our wharves, in our
                                corn markets, meat markers, and other places too numerous to mentron, how useful they
                                are! In our ships, however, the
                                rats oft . them at defiance still they are of great service.</p>
                            <p>How wonderfully patent is the cat when watching for rats or
                                mice, awaiting their egress from their place of refuge or Nat which is their home! How
                                well Shakespeare in Pericles, Act
                                III., descnbes this keen attention of the cat to its natural pursuit!</p>
                            <blockquote>The cat, in eyrie of burning coal, Now crouches horn (before) the mouse, hole.</blockquote>
                            <p>A slight rustle, and the fugitive, comes for, a quick, sharp, resolute motion, and the cat has
                                proved Its usefulness. Let any one have a plague of rats and mice, as I once had,
                                and let them be delivered therefrom by rats, as I was, and
                                they will have a lasting and kind regard for them.</p>
