                <h1>Side-By-Side Positioning Demo</h1>
                <article>
                    <div class="col-45-percent box box-red pos-inline-block">
                        <p>These two divs are positioned next to one another using <span class="snippet-css">display:
                                inline-block</span></p>
                    </div>

                        <p>Notice the space between them. It occurs because of my carriage return in the HTML which I
                            have used to keep the code organized. I have used a reset to ensure no elements should have
                            any default margins or padding. (I did add a bottom margin to make it easier to read.) This
                            space is actually a space character rendered just as it would be between two inline elements
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </article>

                    <div class="col-45-percent box box-green float-left">
                        <p>These two are positioned using <span class="snippet-css">float:left</span></p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-45-percent box box-green float-left">
                        <p>You can see that, even though the elements are spaced in the code, the space is not actually
                            rendered on the page. This
                            may not be a huge deal in these first examples, but...</p>

                <article>
                    <div class="col-50-percent box box-red pos-inline-block">
                        <p>What if I want my side-by-side elements to take up the full width of the parent element? I
                            can set the width of each to 50%, right?</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-50-percent box box-red pos-inline-block">
                        <p>Wrong! Because, together, the two inline block elements will add up to 100% of the available
                            width, but that doesn't account for the space between.

                        <p>The two elements are side by side just as I intended and fill the entire width of the parent (which, in this case, is the same as the width of the viewport.
