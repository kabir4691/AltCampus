                        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
                        <p>Harry opened his eyes. He was lying on the floor of Professor Trelawney's room with his hands
                            over his face. His scar
                            was still burning so badly that his eyes were watering. The pain had been real. The whole
                            class was standing around him,
                            and Ron was kneeling next to him, looking terrified. "You all right?" he said. "Of course he
                            isn't!" said Professor
                            Trelawney, looking thoroughly excited. Her great eyes loomed over Harry, gazing at him.
                            "What was it. Potter? A
                            premonition? An apparition? What did you see?" "Nothing," Harry lied. He sat up. He could
                            feel himself shaking. He
                            couldn't stop himself from looking around, into the shadows behind him; Voldemorts voice had
                            sounded so close. . . .
                            "You were clutching your scar!" said Professor Trelawney. "You were rolling on the floor,
                            clutching your scar! Come now.
                            Potter, I have experience in these matters!" Harry looked up at her.</p>
