                    <p>"No," she said, continuing to pace. "Not unless you can answer my riddle. Answer on your first
                        guess - I let you pass.
                        Answer wrongly - I attack. Remain silent - I will let you walk away from me unscathed." Harry's
                        stomach slipped several
                        notches. It was Hermione who was good at this sort of thing, not him. He weighed his chances. If
                        the riddle was too
                        hard, he could keep silent, get away from the sphinx unharmed, and try and find an alternative
                        route to the center.
                        "Okay," he said. "Can I hear the riddle?"</p>
                    <p>"I merely thought," said Snape, in a voice of forced calm, "that if Potter was wandering around
                        after hours again ...
                        it's an unfortunate habit of his ... he should be stopped. For - for his own safety." "Ah, I
                        see," said Moody softly.
                        "Got Potter's best interests at heart, have you?"</p>
                    <p>"Ladies first," he said, offering it to Fleur Delacour. She put a shaking hand inside the bag and
                        drew out a tiny,
                        perfect model of a dragon - a Welsh Green. It had the number two around its neck And Harry knew,
                        by the fact that Fleur
                        showed no sign of surprise, but rather a determined resignation, that he had been right: Madame
                        Maxime had told her what
                        was coming.</p>

                    <p>"This is really nice of you," Harry muttered to Mrs. Weasley. "I thought for a moment - the
                        Dursleys -" "Hmm," said Mrs.
                        Weasley, pursing her lips. She had always refrained from criticizing the Dursleys in front of
                        Harry, but her eyes
                        flashed every time they were mentioned.</p>
                    <p>"Could be anywhere," said Moody, shaking his head. "Only thing we know for sure is that he's not
                        here." He yawned
                        widely, so that his scars stretched, and his lopsided mouth revealed a number of missing teeth.
                        Then he said, "Now,
                        Dumbledore's told me you three fancy yourselves as investigators, but there's nothing you can do
                        for Crouch. The
                        Ministry'll be looking for him now, Dumbledore's notified them. Potter, you just keep your mind
                        on the third task."
                        "What?" said Harry. "Oh yeah . . ."</p>
                    <p>"If Dad hadn't said anything, old Rita would just have said it was disgraceful that nobody from
                        the Ministry had
                        commented," said Bill, who was playing chess with Ron. "Rita Skeeter never makes anyone look
                        good. Remember, she
                        interviewed all the Gringotts' Charm Breakers once, and called me 'a long-haired pillock'?"</p>
